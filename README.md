**Clipboard Manager with eframe UI**

This Rust application saves clipboard content in a history and allows users to view and select past clipboard entries through an interactive UI built with eframe and egui.

Features:

- Clipboard Monitoring: Automatically saves new clipboard entries to a history log.
- Selectable History: Displays clipboard history in a UI where users can select entries.
- Keyboard Navigation: Use arrow keys to navigate the history and Enter to set the clipboard to the selected entry.

This project demonstrates real-time clipboard monitoring and a responsive UI in Rust.
